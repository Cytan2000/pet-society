            About Pet Sitting For Small Pets Only (East Coast)
Summary.

My daughter (Shermaine) and I are providing pet sitting services for birds only. We are both animal lovers. She works at the zoo while I work in the turf club. <br/><br/>

As a standard practice, food/cage/stand/toys have to be provided by the owner so that your pet(s) will have a similar diet and feel comfortable in a new environment. We will:
- send video daily
- replenish and clean up daily
- ensure sufficient playtime
- shower/bathe them at least once every 5 days.

If you like to, our pet sitting services are customisable and on a request basis.

Pick up / Drop off services are also available.
